# HIPE OCRepair 2026 - Impresso-OCR-Bench


[HIPE-OCRepair-2026](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-OCRepair-2026/) is a [ICDAR 2026 Competition](https://icdar2026.org/index.php/competitions/) focused on **LLM-assisted OCR post-correction of historical documents**, with a particular emphasis on historical newspapers, but not only.


With renewed interest driven by large language models (LLMs), OCR post-correction has (re)gained momentum, resulting into a growing number of models and experimental approaches. However, these efforts often rely on heterogeneous legacy datasets that come with important limitations, making systematic evaluation and meaningful comparison across approaches difficult. 

A central question motivating this competition is:

**To what extent can modern large language models address the OCR debt accumulated in large-scale digitized historical collections?**

The HIPE OCRepair competition aims to support the development and assessment of new models and methods in this area by evaluating LLM-based OCR post-correction approaches on **Impresso-OCR-Bench**, which provides:
- a curated and unified multilingual ground truth dataset for OCR post-correction on historical documents;
- standardised evaluation protocol to ensure comparability and reproducibility.
